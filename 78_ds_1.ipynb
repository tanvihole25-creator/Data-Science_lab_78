        "*   **Purpose of the Expert System:** The expert system is designed for \"Animal Identification,\" aiming to classify animals into categories like Bird, Mammal, Fish, Reptile, or Amphibian based on a set of predefined biological characteristics.\n",
        "*   **Decision-Making Process:** The system makes decisions by evaluating a series of \"if-then\" rules. When given an animal's characteristics (e.g., `has_feathers`, `lays_eggs`), it checks these against the conditions of each rule sequentially. The first rule whose conditions are all met determines the animal's classification. If no rule's conditions are entirely met, the system classifies the animal as \"Unknown.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The expert system's domain is \"Animal Identification,\" chosen for its suitability for simple \"if-then\" rules.\n",
        "*   Five distinct 'if-then' rules were defined and implemented:\n",
        "    *   **Bird:** IF an animal has feathers AND lays eggs.\n",
        "    *   **Mammal:** IF an animal has fur/hair AND gives birth to live young AND produces milk.\n",
        "    *   **Fish:** IF an animal lives in water AND has gills AND lays eggs AND is cold-blooded.\n",
        "    *   **Reptile:** IF an animal has scales AND lays eggs AND is cold-blooded AND does not live in water.\n",
        "    *   **Amphibian:** IF an animal lays eggs AND lives in water AND is cold-blooded AND does not have gills.\n",
        "*   The Python implementation, `identify_animal`, successfully classified example animals according to these rules, such as identifying an animal with `has_feathers=True` and `lays_eggs=True` as a \"Bird\".\n",
        "*   The system correctly returned \"Unknown animal type based on current rules\" when provided with characteristic combinations that did not match any defined rule, for example, `has_fur_hair=True` and `lays_eggs=True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current system demonstrates a basic rule-based expert system. To enhance its utility, consider adding more specific rules for subclasses of animals (e.g., types of birds or mammals) or incorporating a confidence score for identification.\n",
        "*   Improve the user experience by allowing a more natural language input for characteristics or by integrating a more sophisticated rule engine for easier rule management and expansion.\n"
